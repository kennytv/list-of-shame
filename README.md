## List Of Shame

A non exhaustive list of projects to be known to have rather unpleasant vibes.

* [Yatopia](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia), "The combined power of Paper forks for maximum instability and unmaintainablity!" - Messy, tossed salad of people that haven't even really understood the patch system.
* [SkinsRestorer](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX), "`System.out.println("[SkinsRestorer] ")`, `try {} catch (Exception e) {}`" - The cleanest code it has comes from one-time contributors.
* [FlameCord](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/13492/), "Are you sick of using sane, open-source software? Try this mcmarket Travertine fork!" - While it has some nice workarounds to vulnerabilities, it's done on the wrong layer and contains some rather weird changes as well.
* Literally any closed-source (paid) 1.8 Paper fork on mcmarket, "\[Optimized\] \[Cannons\] \[Everything is multithreaded\]" - Mostly just copied off each other with little to no actual work involved or improvements done, with many even introducing major bugs or including security breaches.


## Disclaimer

This list does not mean you *must not* use any of the above mentioned, but just that some random person on the internet considers some of their design choices questionable. Have a nice day, k thx bai.
