## List Of Shame
A non-exhaustive list of projects to be known to have rather unpleasant vibes.

* [Yatopia](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia), "The combined power of Paper forks for maximum instability and unmaintainablity!" - Messy, tossed salad of people that haven't even really understood the patch system.
* [Yatopia](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia), *no really, [it's bad](https://github.com/KennyTV/Yaptapia)*
* [SkinsRestorer](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX), "`System.out.println("[SkinsRestorer] ")`, `try {} catch (Exception e) {}`" - The cleanest code it has comes from one-time contributors.
* [EntityTrackerFixer](https://github.com/Esmorall/EntityTrackerFixer), "Minecraft tracks alot of entities - so let's disable that, who needs entities to work as intended anyway ;^)", not to mention that Paper already implements most of its fixes
* Literally any closed-source (paid) 1.8 Paper fork on mcmarket, "\[Optimized\] \[Cannons\] \[Everything is multithreaded\]" - Mostly just copied off each other with little to no actual work involved or improvements done, with many even introducing major bugs or including security breaches.
  - Hyperion - someone [tried to exclude them from the above bullet point](https://github.com/KennyTV/list-of-shame/pull/15), then [tried to remove this mention of their original PR in a new PR](https://github.com/KennyTV/list-of-shame/pull/17), while also having a miner running on their GitHub Pages.
* [Kangarko](https://github.com/kangarko), "Become self-hated now" - Who needs well-made, free Java courses like [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) anyways, if you can use Kangarko's overpriced one! Uses every place humanly possible to advertise his service, and likes to silently push blame towards other people.
  - Latest victim of Kangarko's blame: [All of SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/478408/)
* [Yooniks](https://www.mc-market.org/members/126711/), "The embodiment of MCM" - If you feel like you have too much money and you are looking for horrible, closed-source forks of Bungee/Spigot, Yooniks is your guy. He's so good that even MCM banned him for being an ass.
* [ClearLagg](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/clearlagg.68271/), "Use one of ClearLagg's many utilities to make lag" - Causes more lag than it removes and doesn't even know its own name.
* [CMI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmi.3742/), "Over 280 must have bugs for your server!" - A (non-)substitute for EssentialsX for the people that think paid=good.
* [Songoda](https://songoda.com/marketplace), "The one top sketchy marketplace for Minecraft plugins" - Because it doesn't get more sketchy than Songoda.
* [NeruxVace](https://neruxvace.net/), "Money ain't got wings!" - Minigames network that won't let anything stand in the way of its urge for "success". Whether it's paying developers, or simply following up on (legal-)agreements - Noah Kemm doesn't need any of that!
* [Mortal Mines](https://mortalmines.com/), Network that mass DM bots discord servers to gain players for a pay2win prison server. Alexander Didio (aka LizardZ or Energy) has owned and killed OPMines, Sparkverse, WickedSkies, FrostyMC, and Jurassic Mines after two months once their playerbase has been milked dry.
* 1.8, "An outdated version of Minecraft with more security issues than features!" - Hasn't been updated in [almost 6 years](https://howoldisminecraft188.today/).
* [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion), "1.8-1.16 KitPVP" - Enables **the evil** to continue to live.
* [ProtocolSupport](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocolsupport.7201/), - Like ViaBackwards, just with more **evil**.
* [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4), "It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From taking 70% of your tick to clearing inventories at random!" - Tries to turn your server in an FTB modpack... *tries to*.
* [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fast-async-worldedit.13932), "It's async, so that means it's better!" - Aims to be a fast fork of WorldEdit, it sure is fast, fast at breaking things.
* [AsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/asyncworldedit-premium.9661/), "*It's async, so that means it's better!*" - Like FAWE, but slower and breaking the WorldEdit license.
* [IllegalStack](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dupe-fixes-illegal-stack-remover.44411/), "Dupe & Exploit fixer" - Actually introduces dupes, eats 15% of your ticks, and likes to do wonky things like removing nametags of players and entities.
* [EpicWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/epicworldgenerator.8067/), "Get the best lagg you can buy for money" - Because it sure is worth spending $20 (originally $40) for something that has several free alternatives with the same features.
  - Let's also point out the fact that it is [based almost entirely on code directly stolen from a free mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/km185p/epic_world_generator_is_based_almost_entirely_on/) ([Realistic World Gen](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1281910-teds-world-gen-mods-realistic-world-gen-alpha-1-3))
* [PM2](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/pm2.597961/), "Update your plugin 500 times with single additions and fixes!" - Good review and resource bumping.
* [SunLight](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sunlight-%E2%80%A2-server-management-plugin-essentials-1-14-1-16.67733/) - "Advanced server management plugin with all the plugin-breaking bugs your server needs!" It takes RGB chat formatting to a whole other level, parsing hex codes in *other plugins'* commands. When the author was asked about it, they said that the only way around it is to [use their library to convert them back](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/sunlight-%E2%80%A2-server-management-plugin-essentials-1-14-1-16.374716/page-39#post-4124177).
* [Mohist](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist), "Get all the worst parts of Bukkit and Forge and mash them together" - [Swapped Essentials' plugin jar](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist/blob/70a303f4d02e9480cc5472c1c26f7d9cb6560732/src/fmllauncher/java/com/mohistmc/AutoDeletePlugins.java#L20-L22) after trying to [submit a PR](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/pull/3580) to Essentials to fix their own butchering of the Bukkit API. *Then* tried to turn [Essentials' PSA](https://essentialsx.net/do-not-use-mohist.html) regarding security concerns [into an ad](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Website/pull/44).
* [Retrooper](https://github.com/KennyTV/list-of-shame/issues/46)
* [Catserver](https://github.com/luohuayu/catserver) - "Whatever, Catserver is compatible with most of mohist's plugins, the only thing to do is to edit the event references.  I don't know why but I have migrated many plugins from Catserver to Mohist with almost no modification."

## Software Alternatives / Info Threads
This section is the only part of this page you should *actually* take somewhat seriously.

* "Super optimized all-in-one server" alternatives: Paper, Tuinity, Airplane, Purpur (most performant and properly stable will likely be Tuinity)
  * Info: https://github.com/KennyTV/Yaptapia (not necessarily bound to Yatopia)
* "Hybrid" (Forge/something else + Bukkit) server info/alternatives: [Essentials' PSA](https://essentialsx.net/do-not-use-mohist.html).
* Anti-lag plugin alternative setup and info: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/283181/ and https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/283181/page-20#post-3684550
* Dupe fixer alternative: Use Paper (or one of its **sane** forks) and stay on the latest version of Minecraft... unless you run a creative server, then plugins make sense to clear data-spammed items
* EWG info/alternatives: https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/km185p/epic_world_generator_is_based_almost_entirely_on/
* SkinsRestorer alternative: *For the love of god, **don't use offline mode***
* CMI alternative: EssentialsX, given its free, open source, and you are less likely to run into problems, or will have them fixed faster... tho there is nothing wrong with liking CMI how it is, either

## Disclaimer
This list does not mean you *must not* use any of the above mentioned, or that all of them are *truly* horrible,
but just that random people on the internet consider some of their (design) choices questionable.
Take it lightly and please correct any plainly wrong information.
Have a nice day, k thx bai.
