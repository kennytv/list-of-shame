## List Of Shame
A non-exhaustive list of projects to be known to have rather unpleasant vibes.

* [Yatopia](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia), "The combined power of Paper forks for maximum instability and unmaintainablity!" - Messy, tossed salad of people that haven't even really understood the patch system.
* [SkinsRestorer](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX), "`System.out.println("[SkinsRestorer] ")`, `try {} catch (Exception e) {}`" - The cleanest code it has comes from one-time contributors.
* [FlameCord](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/13492/), "Are you sick of using sane, open-source software? Try this MC-market Travertine fork!" - While it has some nice workarounds to vulnerabilities, it's done on the wrong layer and contains some rather weird changes as well.
* [EntityTrackerFixer](https://github.com/Esmorall/EntityTrackerFixer), "Minecraft tracks alot of entities - so let's disable that, who needs entities to work as intended anyway ;^)" - Just use Paper, please. It fixes the issue without producing even more problems.
* Literally any closed-source (paid) 1.8 Paper fork on mcmarket, "\[Optimized\] \[Cannons\] \[Everything is multithreaded\]" - Mostly just copied off each other with little to no actual work involved or improvements done, with many even introducing major bugs or including security breaches.
  - Hyperion - someone [tried to exclude them from the above bullet point](https://github.com/KennyTV/list-of-shame/pull/15), then [tried to remove this mention of their original PR in a new PR](https://github.com/KennyTV/list-of-shame/pull/17), while having a crypto miner running on their GitHub Pages
* [Kangarko](https://github.com/kangarko), "Become self-hated now" - Offers overprized Spigot/Java courses (use [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) instead), uses every place humanly possible to advertise his service, and likes to silently push blame towards other people.
* [Spartan](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spartan-advanced-anti-cheat-hack-blocker.25638/), "A premium product with setting your server on fire in mind, made by ad spammers" - Checks are largely bypassable and the plugin page has such awesome quotes as "A Minecraft server uses just one CPU core".
* [ClearLagg](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/clearlagg.68271/), "Use one of ClearLagg's many utilities to make lag" - Causes more lag than it removes and doesn't even know its own name.
* [CMI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmi.3742/), "Over 280 must have bugs for your server!" - A (non-)substitute for EssentialsX, but it doesn't patch bugs.
* [Songoda](https://songoda.com/marketplace), "The one top sketchy marketplace for Minecraft plugins" - The plugins are *oof* and Songoda as a business has engaged in sketchy practices.
* [NeruxVace](https://neruxvace.net/), "Money ain't got wings!" - Small german minigames network that won't let anything stand in the way of its urge for "success". Whether it's paying developers, or simply following up on (legal-)agreements - Noah Kemm doesn't give a damn.
* 1.8, "An outdated version of Minecraft with mindless pvp" - Hasn't been updated in 5 years.
* [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion) "1.8-1.16 KitPVP" - Enables servers to stay on unsupported versions of Minecraft while allowing newer versions to join. Not a bad plugin, but used as a tool for **evil**.
* [ProtocolSupport](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocolsupport.7201/) - Like ViaBackwards, just with more **evil**.
* [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4) "It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From taking 70% of your tick to clearing inventories at random!" - Tries to turn your server in an FTB modpack, and does not achieve its goal due to developers not knowing what they are doing.
* [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fast-async-worldedit.13932) "It's async, so that means it's better!" - Aims to be a fast fork of WorldEdit, it sure is fast, fast at breaking things.
* [IllegalStack](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dupe-fixes-illegal-stack-remover.44411/) "Dupe & Exploit fixer" - Actually introduces dupes, eats 15% of your ticks, and likes to do wonky things like removing nametags of players and entities.

## Disclaimer
