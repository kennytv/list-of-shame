## List Of Shame
A non exhaustive list of projects to be known to have rather unpleasant vibes.

* [Yatopia](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia), "The combined power of Paper forks for maximum instability and unmaintainablity!" - Messy, tossed salad of people that haven't even really understood the patch system.
* [SkinsRestorer](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX), "`System.out.println("[SkinsRestorer] ")`, `try {} catch (Exception e) {}`" - The cleanest code it has comes from one-time contributors.
* [FlameCord](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/13492/), "Are you sick of using sane, open-source software? Try this mcmarket Travertine fork!" - While it has some nice workarounds to vulnerabilities, it's done on the wrong layer and contains some rather weird changes as well.
* [EntityTrackerFixer](https://github.com/Esmorall/EntityTrackerFixer), "Minecraft tracks alot of entities - so let's disable that, who needs entities to work as intended anyway ;^)" - Just use Paper, please. It fixes the issue without producing even more problems.
* Literally any closed-source (paid) 1.8 Paper fork on mcmarket, "\[Optimized\] \[Cannons\] \[Everything is multithreaded\]" - Mostly just copied off each other with little to no actual work involved or improvements done, with many even introducing major bugs or including security breaches.
* [Kangarko](https://github.com/kangarko), "Become self-hated now" - Offers overprized Spigot/Java courses (use [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) instead), uses every place humanly possible to advertise his service, and likes to silently push blame towards other people.
* [Spartan](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spartan-advanced-anti-cheat-hack-blocker.25638/), "A premium product with setting your server on fire in mind, made by ad spammers" - Checks are largely bypassable and the plugin page has such awesome quotes as "A Minecraft server uses just one CPU core".
* [ClearLagg](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/clearlagg.68271/), "Use one of clearlag's many utilities to make lag" - Causes more lag than it removes and doesn't even know its own name.
* [CMI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmi.3742/), "Over 280 must have bugs for your server!" - A (non-)substitue for EssentialsX, but it doesn't patch bugs.
* [Songoda](https://songoda.com/marketplace), "The one stop sketchy marketplace for Minecraft plugins" - The plugins are *oof* and Songoda as a business has engaged in sketchy practices. In fact, they're banned by Paypal.
* 1.8, "An outdated version of Minecraft with mindless pvp" - Hasn't been updated in 5 years.
