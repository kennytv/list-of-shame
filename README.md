## List Of Shame
A non-exhaustive list of projects to be known to have rather unpleasant vibes.

* [Yatopia](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia), [SugarcaneMC](https://github.com/SugarcaneMC/Sugarcane) & [Mirai](https://github.com/etil2jz/Mirai), "The combined power of Paper forks for maximum instability!" - Tossed salad of people that haven't even really understood the patch system. And yes, *[it's that bad](https://github.com/kennytv/Yaptapia)*
* [StellarDev](https://stellardev.org/), "Stealing code, but professionally" - Aside from the usual closed-source Spigot forks, get paid thousands to steal code without attribution, [bar a little slip up...](https://github.com/NFT-Worlds/Server/blob/4f7bc3329aadac0667b8bb8d6d384558566af6ff/patches/server/0046-Async-Entities.patch#L238)<!-- Even more ironic if you look at who this was made for -->
* [WorldQL](https://www.worldql.com/posts/2021-08-worldql-scalable-minecraft/) - Interesting project with a promising idea, but with Sugarcane-level advertising, vastly blown out of proportion, and already containing countless ðŸš© in their Spigot plugin.
* [SkinsRestorer](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX) - "`System.out.println("[SkinsRestorer] ")`, `try {} catch (Exception e) {}`"
* [EntityTrackerFixer](https://github.com/Esmorall/EntityTrackerFixer), "Minecraft tracks alot of entities - so let's just not do that" - Just use Paper, man.
* Every single closed-source (paid) 1.8 Paper fork on mcmarket, "\[Optimized\] \[Cannons\] \[Everything is multithreaded\]" - Mostly just copied off each other with little to no actual work involved or improvements done, with many even introducing major bugs or including security breaches.
  - Hyperion - someone [tried to exclude them from the above bullet point](https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/pull/15), then [tried to remove this mention of their original PR in a new PR](https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/pull/17).
* [Kangarko](https://github.com/kangarko), "Become self-hated now" - Who needs well-made, free Java courses like [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) anyways, if you can use Kangarko's! Uses every place humanly possible to advertise the service.
  - Latest victim of Kangarko's blame: [All of SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/478408/)
* [Yooniks](https://www.mc-market.org/members/126711/) - If you feel like you have too much money and you are looking for closed-source forks of Bungee/Spigot, Yooniks is your guy. He's so good, even MCM banned him for being an ass.
* [ClearLagg](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/clearlagg.68271/), "Use one of ClearLagg's many utilities to make lag" - Causes more lag than it removes and doesn't even know its own name.
* [CMI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmi.3742/), "Over 280 must have bugs for your server!" - A (non-)substitute for EssentialsX for the people that think paid=good.
* [Songoda](https://songoda.com/marketplace), "The one-stop sketchy marketplace for Minecraft plugins" - Because it doesn't get more sketchy than Songoda.
* [NeruxVace](https://neruxvace.net/), "Money ain't got wings!" - Minigames network that won't let anything stand in the way of its urge for "success". Who needs to pay devs anyways.
* 1.8, "An outdated version of Minecraft with more security issues than features!" - Hasn't been updated in [quite a bunch of years](https://howoldisminecraft188.today/).
* [ViaVersion](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion), "1.8-1.18 KitPVP" - Enables **the evil** to continue to live.
* [ProtocolSupport](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocolsupport.7201/), - Like ViaBackwards, just with even more **evil**.
* [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4), "It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From taking 70% of your tick to clearing inventories at random!" - Tries to turn your server in an FTB modpack, but a lot more cursed.
* [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fast-async-worldedit.13932), "Fast async world exception" - Fast, fast at breaking things.
* [AsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/asyncworldedit-premium.9661/), "Async world exception" - Like FAWE, but slower and breaking the WorldEdit license.
* [IllegalStack](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dupe-fixes-illegal-stack-remover.44411/) - Actually introduces dupes, eats 15% of your ticks, and likes to do wonky things like removing nametags of players and entities.
* [EpicWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/epicworldgenerator.8067/) - Because it sure is worth spending $20 (originally $40) for something that has several free alternatives with the same features.
  - Let's also point out the fact that it is [based almost entirely on code directly stolen from a free mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/km185p/epic_world_generator_is_based_almost_entirely_on/) ([Realistic World Gen](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1281910-teds-world-gen-mods-realistic-world-gen-alpha-1-3))
* [PM2](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/pm2.597961/), "Update your plugin 500 times with single additions and fixes!" - 10/10 review and resource bumping. (Not to be confused with [pm2 Process Manager](https://pm2.io/))
* [SunLight](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sunlight.67733/) - "Advanced server management plugin with all the plugin-breaking bugs your server needs!" It takes RGB chat formatting to a whole other level, parsing hex codes in *other plugins'* commands with the only way around that being to [use their library to convert them back](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/sunlight.374716/page-39#post-4124177).
* [ProVotes](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/provotes.23672/) - Premium in the [least premium way possible](https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/issues/77).
* [Mohist](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist), "Get the worst parts of Bukkit and Forge and mash them together" - [Swapped Essentials' plugin jar](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist/blob/70a303f4d02e9480cc5472c1c26f7d9cb6560732/src/fmllauncher/java/com/mohistmc/AutoDeletePlugins.java#L20-L22) after trying to [submit a PR](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/pull/3580) to Essentials to fix their own cuckery of the Bukkit API. *Then* tried to turn [Essentials' PSA](https://essentialsx.net/do-not-use-mohist.html) regarding security concerns [into an ad](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Website/pull/44).
* [Retrooper](https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/issues/46)
* [Retrooper, again](https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/pull/67)
* [The Duper Trooper](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Nuc3040H1WjeO9aoY4NPg) - Clickbait YouTube channel that "leaks" exploits and other security related issues to the public and encourages its followers to report to them instead of disclosing properly. And yes, [they actually do](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/155145799796391936/877016425221459978/unknown.png).
* [kennytv](https://www.twitch.tv/kennytvn) - German streamer who has repeatedly failed to meet streaming obligations
* [NFTWorlds](https://www.nftworlds.com) - Selling [Minecraft seeds and skins](https://opensea.io/collection/nft-worlds) on the blockchain and [getting mad at Mojang](https://routing.nftworlds.com/ipfs/QmXRLKdmEReiTWoESHFfUUrJoWkUX2obye3urL6x8zt5Bx) when they [disallowed their practices](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-and-nfts).

## Software Alternatives / Info Threads
This section is the only part of this page you should *actually* take somewhat seriously.

* "Super optimized all-in-one server" alternatives: The most performant AND properly stable will likely always be Paper
  * Info: <https://github.com/kennytv/Yaptapia> (not necessarily bound to Yatopia)
* "Hybrid" (Forge/something else + Bukkit) server info/alternatives: [Essentials' PSA](https://essentialsx.net/do-not-use-mohist.html).
* Anti-lag plugin alternative setup and info: <https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/283181/> and <https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/283181/page-20#post-3684550>
* Dupe fixer alternative: Use Paper (or one of its **sane** forks) and stay on the latest version of Minecraft... unless you run a creative server, then plugins make sense to clear data-spammed items
* EWG info/alternatives: <https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/km185p/epic_world_generator_is_based_almost_entirely_on/>
* SkinsRestorer alternative: *For the love of god, **don't use offline mode***
* CMI alternative: EssentialsX, given its free, open source, and you are less likely to run into problems, or will have them fixed faster... though there is nothing wrong with liking CMI how it is, either
